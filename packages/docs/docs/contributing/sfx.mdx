We welcome sound effect contributions to the [`@remotion/sfx`](/docs/sfx) package.

## Requirements

Sound effects must be:

- **WAV format**
- **CC0 (Creative Commons 0) licensed** — no attribution required by users
- **Normalized** so the peak is at **-3dB** (use FFmpeg / coding agent to normalize)

Good sources for CC0 sound effects are [freesound.org](https://freesound.org) and [kenney.nl](https://kenney.nl).

## Adding a sound effect

Use the [`/add-sfx` Claude Code skill](https://github.com/remotion-dev/remotion/blob/main/.claude/skills/add-sfx/SKILL.md) to add a new sound effect. It will guide you through all the necessary steps.
