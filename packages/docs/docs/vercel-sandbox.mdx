Vercel Sandbox allows you to render videos on-demand without managing Lambda or AWS infrastructure.  
Each render spawns an ephemeral Linux VM with full access to the Remotion renderer.

As a reference implementation, we have created a template: [Next.js Sandbox Template](https://remotion.dev/templates/vercel).

## Starter Template

Use our [Next.js template](/templates/vercel) to get started quickly.
You can deploy with one-click using the button below:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?demo-description=Render%20your%20Remotion%20videos%20on%20Vercel.&demo-image=%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fe5382hct74si%2F4pq2kfE4t05fMkDCKGsfqz%2F1444f1b559d50391052fdf5102502ac9%2FFlagsmith_Dark.png&demo-title=Remotion%20on%20Vercel&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Ftemplate-vercel.remotion.dev%2F&from=templates&products=%255B%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522blob%2522%257D%255D&project-name=Remotion%20on%20Vercel&project-names=Comma%20separated%20list%20of%20project%20names%2Cto%20match%20the%20root-directories&repository-name=remotion-on-vercel&repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fremotion-dev%2Ftemplate-vercel&root-directories=List%20of%20directory%20paths%20for%20the%20directories%20to%20clone%20into%20projects)

Or, [visit the Remotion on Vercel template](https://vercel.com/templates/template/remotion-on-vercel) on Vercel's template marketplace.

### Manual

Use the Vercel template:

```bash
npx create-video@latest --template vercel
```

Push it to Vercel.

Then, in your Vercel dashboard, under "Storage", create a new Blob store and connect it to the project.  
Redeploy for the changes to take effect.

## `@remotion/vercel` package

import {TableOfContents} from './vercel/table-of-contents';

The [`@remotion/vercel`](/docs/vercel/api) package provides a programmatic API for rendering Remotion videos on Vercel Sandbox. The template uses this package under the hood.

<TableOfContents />

## Important considerations

**No rate limiting or caching**: The template does not include rate limiting or caching. Any user with access to your deployment can trigger renders, which incur costs on your Vercel account. Before making your app publicly available, implement rate limiting and authentication, and set up [Vercel Spend Management](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/spend-management) to control costs.

**Renders are stored permanently**: Videos uploaded to Vercel Blob storage persist indefinitely and incur ongoing storage costs. Implement a cleanup strategy to delete old renders that are no longer needed.

## Advantages

This is the easiest way to setup Remotion server-side rendering. You only need one Vercel account and connect a blob storage - then you just push to deploy.

Vercel has higher limits than Lambda by default, so you can render more videos at once than with a fresh AWS account.

Allowing for 2000 concurrent sandboxes on the Pro Plan allows for massive scale.

## Limitations

Rendering happens on a single machine rather than a distributed system, so it is slower than Lambda.

The Sandbox is heavy, containing Chrome and FFmpeg and takes a few seconds to start up.

## Limits

The timeout limit for Vercel Sandbox is 45 minutes on the Hobby plan, and 5 hours on the Pro and Enterprise plans.  
For concurrency, the limit is 10 simultaneous renders on Hobby, and 2000 on Pro and Enterprise.
