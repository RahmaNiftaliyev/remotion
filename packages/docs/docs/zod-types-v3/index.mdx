import {ZodTypesTableOfContents} from '../zod-types/TableOfContents';

This package provides the same utility types as [`@remotion/zod-types`](/docs/zod-types), but based on Zod 3.22.3 instead of Zod v4.

Use this package if you are composing Remotion's Zod types with your own schemas that use Zod 3.22.3.
If you are using Zod v4, use [`@remotion/zod-types`](/docs/zod-types) instead.  
Other versions of Zod v3 might not compose well – we recommend staying on Zod 3.22.3 or upgrading to Zod v4.
