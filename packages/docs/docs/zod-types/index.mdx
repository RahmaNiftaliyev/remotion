import {ZodTypesTableOfContents} from './TableOfContents';

Since Remotion v4.0.426, `@remotion/zod-types` is based on Zod v4.
If you want to compose these types with your own Zod schemas, use Zod v4.

If you are using Zod 3.22.3, use [`@remotion/zod-types-v3`](/docs/zod-types-v3) instead.
Other versions of Zod v3 might not compose well – we recommend staying on Zod 3.22.3 or upgrading to Zod v4.

Includes utility types and Remotion-specific types for [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod).
