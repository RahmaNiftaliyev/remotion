Since Remotion v4.0.426, `@remotion/zod-types` is based on Zod v4.
If you want, you can now upgrade to Zod v4.

If you want to stay on Zod 3.22.3 as previously required by Remotion, use [`@remotion/zod-types-v3`](/docs/zod-types-v3) instead of [`@remotion/zod-types`](/docs/zod-types).
Other versions of Zod v3 might not compose well – we recommend staying on Zod 3.22.3 or upgrading to Zod v4.

Includes utility types and Remotion-specific types for [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod).
